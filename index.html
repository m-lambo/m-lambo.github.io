	     <div><a href="https://sccapstone.github.io/CulinarApp/">Capstone Project</a>
        <p>For the Capstone Project, my team and I developed an Android application,<i>I am Chef</i>, using the Gradle build system and Firebase services. 
           Designed for chefs and foodies alike, <i>I am Chef</i> combines recipe gathering and storing into a customizable app suited for many different lifestyles.
           We used the open source MealDB api for the recipes and stored copies of them, as well as their pictures, in Firebase's Cloud Database and in Cloud Storage, respectively.</p>
       <div><a href="https://carlyleletters.dukeupress.edu/home">Carlyle Letters Online</a></div>
         <p>For the Carlylye Letters Online, I worked in an interdisciplinary team on an internet archive of a famous correspondence between the Carlylye's and Friends.
          Primarily working on the Advanced Search feature of our site, I expanded its features and performed quality assurance to make sure everything was in working order.
          Additionally, I modified the layout of the page using CSS Flexbox.

	     <div><a href="https://ruskindigitalarchive.cdhsc.org/">The Ruskin Digital Archive</a></div>
         <p>For the Ruskin Digital Archive, I worked in the same team on a letter correspondence between John Ruskin and Friends. I put together the <i>Resources</i> page.</p>
	     <div><a href="https://github.com/m-lambo/weather-station">Raspberry Pi Weather Station</a></div>
       <p>For the weather station I displayed initiative and desire to learn by doing a solo project in the summer and learning Python to implement
        a mini-weather station that detects air humidity, temperature and pressure. I have plans to extend it by attaching an Alexa skill to it and use the Subscriber design pattern.
