       </p>For the Capstone project I worked on a recipe application for chefs and foodies alike.
       With many different lifestyle/diet options, the app is made for people with a variety of tastes.
       I used the MVVM design pattern for my page.

      <div><a href="https://carlyleletters.dukeupress.edu/home">Carlyle Letters Online</a></div>
        <p>For the </i>Carlyle Letters Online</i> I worked with a team as part of an internship
          that was designed to keep the legacy of some historians alive by helping maintain
          an internet archive of a letter correspondence between the Carlyles and friends.
	     <div><a href="https://ruskindigitalarchive.cdhsc.org/">The Ruskin Digital Archive</a></div>
         <p>For the Ruskin Digital Archive, I worked in the same team on a letter correspondence between John Ruskin and Friends. I put together the <i>Resources</i> page.</p>
	     <div><a href="https://github.com/m-lambo/weather-station">Raspberry Pi Weather Station</a></div>
       <p>For the weather station I displayed initiative and desire to learn by doing a solo project in the summer and learning Python to implement
        a mini-weather station that detects air humidity, temperature and pressure. I have plans to extend it by attaching an Alexa skill to it and use the Subscriber design pattern.
